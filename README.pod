Map-Functional

This distribution provides Map::Functional, which offers `fmap`: map without
trampling the global topic variable.

The problem:

    sub do_something {
        ...
        # accidentally trample the global topic variable
        ...
    }

    my %values = map { $_ => do_something($_) } 1..5;

    # %values will likely surprise you!

The solution:

    use Map::Functional 'fmap';

    my %values = fmap ($i) { $i => do_something($i) } 1..5;

`fmap` allows you to name the iteration variable, and use it in the BLOCK without concern of whether called subs or methods will accidentally alter it.
